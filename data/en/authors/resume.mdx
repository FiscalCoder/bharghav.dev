# ðŸ§‘ Bharghav Raman

Over the past 3+ years as a Software Engineer, I've dived deep into building transformative products for both the consumer and Edtech worlds. From the initial design phase to rigorous development, integration, and even hands-on server management, I've been there every step of the way. What drives me isn't just the code, but the thrill of crafting robust, user-centric solutions that not only address immediate needs but also stand resilient in the face of evolving challenges.
